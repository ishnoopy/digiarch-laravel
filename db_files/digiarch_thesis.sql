However, the usefulness of this approach in developing\r\nclinically validated diagnostic techniques so far has been limited and the methods\r\nare prone to overfitting and other problems which may not be immediately\r\napparent to the investigators. This commentary is intended to help sensitize\r\ninvestigators as well as readers and reviewers of papers to some potential pitfalls in\r\nthe development of classifiers, and suggests steps that researchers can take to help\r\navoid these problems. Building classifiers should be viewed not simply as an add-on\r\nstatistical analysis, but as part and parcel of the experimental process. Validation of\r\nclassifiers for diagnostic applications should be considered as part of a much larger\r\nprocess of establishing the clinical validity of the diagnostic technique.','64eb8a1ec9de9_Machine learning, medical diagnosis, and biomedical engineering research.pdf',18,1,'[\"Artificial intelligence\", \" Classifiers\", \" Image processing\", \" Machine learning\"]',2014,'2023-08-27 17:38:38','2023-08-28 08:41:33'),(3,1,8,'BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE: THE ROLE OF THE INTERNET IN MARKETING RESEARCH AND BUSINESS DECISION-MAKING','[\"Ivana Kursan\", \" Mirela MihiÄ‡\"]','The purpose of this paper is to point out the determinants of the business\r\nintelligence discipline, as applied in marketing practice. The paper examines the\r\nrole of the Internet in marketing research and its implications on the business\r\ndecision-making processes. Although companies conduct a variety of research\r\nmethods in an offline environment, the paper aims to stress the importance of Web\r\nopportunities in conducting the Web segmentation and collecting customer data.\r\nDue to the existence of different perceptions concerning the role of the Internet,\r\nthis paper tries to emphasize its effort of an interactive channel that serves the\r\nfunction of not only an informational nature, but as a powerful research tool as\r\nwell. Several data collection and analysis methods/techniques are discussed that\r\nwould help companies to take advantage of a Web as a significant corporate\r\nresource.','64eb9b3477ec1_Research Paper for Business Intelligence.pdf',5,1,'[\"Economy\", \" Marketing\"]',2010,'2023-08-27 18:51:32','2023-08-28 09:44:21'),(4,4,10,'Diversity in Software Engineering','[\"Meiyappan Nagappan\", \" Thomas Zimmermann\", \" and  Christian Bird\"]','One of the goals of software engineering research is to achieve gen-\r\nerality: Are the phenomena found in a few projects reflective of\r\nothers? Will a technique perform as well on projects other than the\r\nprojects it is evaluated on? While it is common sense to select a\r\nsample that is representative of a population, the importance of di-\r\nversity is often overlooked, yet as important. In this paper, we com-\r\nbine ideas from representativeness and diversity and introduce a\r\nmeasure called sample coverage, defined as the percentage of pro-\r\njects in a population that are similar to the given sample. We intro-\r\nduce algorithms to compute the sample coverage for a given set of\r\nprojects and to select the projects that increase the coverage the\r\nmost. We demonstrate our technique on research presented over\r\nthe span of two years at ICSE and FSE with respect to a population\r\nof 20,000 active open source projects monitored by Ohloh.net.\r\nKnowing the coverage of a sample enhances our ability to reason\r\nabout the findings of a study. Furthermore, we propose reporting\r\nguidelines for research: in addition to coverage scores, papers\r\nshould discuss the target population of the research (universe) and\r\ndimensions that potentially can influence the outcomes of a re-\r\nsearch (space).','64ec5e67770f7_Diversity in Software Engineering Research.pdf',3,2,'[\"Software engineering\", \"  Development\", \"  Computer science\"]',2011,'2023-08-28 08:44:23','2023-08-28 08:53:18');
